        <p class="home__heading">UNTIMATE FRISBEE</p>
        <p class="home__text">Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that I never played myself, but it's popularity is something
            hard to ignore in many Midwestern college towns. Students (and people who wish they were students) spen a
            few brief months of good weather, sprinting down fields, hurling frisbee and yelling "Stack!!"</p>
        <p class="home__text">What I find much more entertaining is large number of people who continue to play when the
            weather gets windy and night sky darkens around oh...4:15pm. The sight of frisbees boomeranging in the wind
            is topped only by the knowledge that even when you can't seem, those sample plastic dics of death are
            probaly hurtling through the dark night at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening</p>
        <p class="home__text">Ultimate frisbee require a great deal of stamina and dexterity. Not surprisingly, the IOC
            officially recornized Ultimate as a sport in 2015. It can go up against other sports for inclusion in
            Olympic games.</p>
